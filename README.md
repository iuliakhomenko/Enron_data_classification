### Project Overview

This project is focused on solving binary classification problem, applying Naive Bayes algorithm to identify 
people involved in Enron fraud case. 

The data used in the project is collected from Enron emails dataset and public Enron financial data. 
The list of people potentially involved in scandal (POI) was compiled manually. 

### Python libraries used in the project

- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- xgboost 

### Project Workflow

1. Data Preparation and Feature Selection
2. Remove outliers
3. Create new features
4. Try different classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Voting Classifier, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes) 
5. Tuning parameters for the classifier that showed best results using sklearn GridSearch
